Future Interns Project_2
I built a Marketing Dashboard in Power Bi covering data cleaning, DAX and visualization to analyze campaign performance.
KPIs: Average income, Total customers, Response rate, Total spending, Spending from responders and Total acceptances.

Insights
-The campaign performance is measured using Response Rate. 
-AcceptedCmp4 had the highest engagement as it recorded 167 acceptances. This means its tae\rgeting strategy reasonated with miost customers.
-Impression and clicks were absent in this data and response rate is used as proxy CTR. ROI is calculated using revenue generated from responding customers.

Improvements
- Focus on best performing campaigns while low performing campaigns should be redesigned
